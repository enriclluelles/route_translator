# Contributing to RouteTranslator

Looking to contribute something to RouteTranslator? **Here's how you can help.**



## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the RouteTranslator core. Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.**
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.**
3. **Include a live example if possible.**
4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include at least Rails version and gem version. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.



## Key branches

- `master` is the latest, deployed version.
- `develop` is the official development branch for the next release.

## Pull requests

- If your PR fixes bugs or documentation, pull against the `master` branch
- If your PR includes new features, pull against the `develop` branch
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes--keep them simple and small
- **Test.** If you find a bug, write at first a failing test case and then fix it.
- We are open to discussion. If you have troubles or questions, feel free to start a new issue
